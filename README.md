# discourse
for Eb clarinet and computer
<br>
Discourse is a piece for Clarinet in Eb and interactive music system. The original software, also written by the composer, takes the clarinet signal as input and processes the sound in real-time. All of the processing happens live, so there are no prerecorded sounds in the piece. In other words, the computer's performance is data-driven by the clarinet's performance.
The clarinet begins a conversation with the computer which responds by imitating the clarinet and expanding upon its ideas. These two voices continue their dialogue: formulating responses to the other's last statement, pausing to listen to each other, and even stuttering at times while trying to answer appropriately.

Duration 5 minutes and 30 seconds<br>
A clock is given in the software. The clock numbers should correlate to time markings in this score when played at tempo. The performer needs only to press space bar on a computer running the Discourse software, and begin playing when the software cues to "begin".
