# discourse
for Eb clarinet and computer
<br>
Discourse is a piece for Clarinet in Eb and interactive music system. The original software, also written by the composer, takes the clarinet signal as input and processes the sound in real-time. All of the processing happens live, so there are no prerecorded sounds in the piece. In other words, the computer's performance is data-driven by the clarinet's performance.
The clarinet begins a conversation with the computer which responds by imitating the clarinet and expanding upon its ideas. These two voices continue their dialogue: formulating responses to the other's last statement, pausing to listen to each other, and even stuttering at times while trying to answer appropriately.

<br><br>
Duration 5 minutes and 30 seconds<br>
* A clock is given in the software. The clock numbers should correlate to time markings in this score when played at tempo. The performer needs only to cick the "Start" button or press the space bar on a computer running the Discourse software, and begin playing when the software cues you to "begin".<br>
* To simulate a performance as a demo, check the box labeled "Enable Demo..." and then click the Start button.<br>
* By default, the input from the microphone is only used to drive the effects, so the level of the computer sounds can largely be controlled by the performer depending on how loudly the play into the microphone; please keep this in mind because the computer sounds can get really loud if desired. 
<br><br>
Requires Max 8 or later<br>
* From the Max package manager, install the EAMIR SDK package and the Miraweb package.<br>
